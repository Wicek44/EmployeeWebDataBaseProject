# EmployeeWebDataBaseProject

## About project

In this project I used the MySQL DataBase. Data base have basic example information about employees like: name, last name, salary or role in company. 

## Employee data base

I created example user accounts, roles and assigned a few sample accounts depending on their permissions. 

There are four different accounts: Administrator, Accountant, Employee, Guest - each of them has access to other data, display them other information, and has other permissions and possibilities to change them or not.

To login and check differences between them you can use example accounts:

- Login: Admin1@itcompany.com |	Password: administrator1Pass
- Login: Employee2@itcompany.com 	| Password: employee2Pass
- Login: Accountant3@itcompany.com	| Password: accountant3Pass
- Login: Guest4@itcompany.com	| Password: guest4Pass
